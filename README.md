# Olympic INFO 

A data visualization project that explores Olympic Games statistics through interactive charts and graphs.  
Built as part of the **Visualização de Informação (VI)** course (2022/23).

**Live Demo:** https://nmpc27.github.io/VI-22-23/

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and implement an **interactive data visualization tool** for Olympic data. The process followed several stages:

1.  **Paper Prototype**  – initial sketches of the interface and visualization ideas.
    
2.  **Changes & Improvements**  – refinements based on usability and clarity.
    
3.  **Functional Prototype**  – a working version of the tool with real data.
    
4.  **User Questionnaire**  – evaluation of usability and usefulness with user feedback.

##  User Study

A questionnaire was conducted to evaluate:

-   Clarity of visualizations
    
-   Ease of interaction
    
-   Usefulness of insights
    

Feedback helped refine the design and improve readability (e.g., better labels, orientation adjustments, and new graphs).
